In this project, we focus on breast cancer prediction. There are several important parameters for breast cancer in the dataset we have. We will make predictions by looking at the relationship between them and breast cancer.


# Exploratory Data Analysis

I have a clean dataset with few features so I started to have visualization to see the relation of features and diagnosis. First I checked the barplot of different features with diagnosis(target label) to see the relationship between features and diagnosis. Then I checked for correlation. Finally, I plotted a scatter plot of features with diagnosis.

# Models 
We trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, KNN for this project and checked for their confusion matrix as well.
